# Movies-ETL

## Purpose of this repository
Amazing Prime Video is the world's largest online retailer for streaming movies and tv shows. Amazing Prime Video would like to run an analysis which will help them buy streaming rights at a bargain. To connect with the local coding community, Amazing Prime Video will sponsor a hackathon to predict which low budget movies will become popular.
I am tasked with helping prepare a dataset which compiles data from a wikipedia dataset containing all movies released since 1990 and a kaggle dataset containing rating data from Kaggle. This data will be compiled, cleaned, and moved into a PostgreSQL database which will be provided to the participants.
